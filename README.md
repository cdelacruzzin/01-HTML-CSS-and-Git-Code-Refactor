# 01-HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor

## Description
This webpage is an essential guide to digital marketing. It contains sections that gives tips on how to succeed in digital marketing. 
This project was built because websites need to be accessible to everyone. Some people have certain impairments that make it difficult to view this webpage. This project resolves this issue by having proper semantic elements, elements following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, having  accessible alt attributes for images. After completing this project, I learnt many semantic html properties that help a webpage be more accessible, and how to make changes so that there is no DRY code.
